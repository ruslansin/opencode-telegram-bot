# OpenCode Telegram Bot

Telegram bot client for OpenCode that lets you run and monitor coding tasks on your local machine from Telegram.

> Project concept and boundaries are documented in [`CONCEPT.md`](./CONCEPT.md).
> Proposed changes that alter the core interaction model should be discussed before implementation.

## Concept

The app works as a bridge between Telegram and a locally running OpenCode server:

- You send prompts from Telegram
- The bot forwards them to OpenCode
- The app listens to OpenCode SSE events
- Results are aggregated and sent back in Telegram-friendly format

No public inbound ports are required for normal usage.

## Target Usage Scenario

1. The user works on a project locally with OpenCode (Desktop/TUI).
2. They finish the local session and leave the computer.
3. Later, while away, they run this bridge service and connect via Telegram.
4. They choose an existing session or create a new one.
5. They send coding tasks and receive periodic progress updates.
6. They receive completed assistant responses in chat and continue the workflow asynchronously.

## Functional Requirements

### OpenCode server management

- Check OpenCode server status (running / not running)
- Start OpenCode server from the app (`opencode serve`)
- Stop OpenCode server from the app
- Optionally monitor and auto-restart a local OpenCode server
- Optionally stop the local OpenCode server when idle and start it on demand when needed

### Project management

- Fetch available projects from OpenCode API (name + path)
- Select and switch projects
- Persist selected project between restarts (`settings.json`)

### Session management

- Fetch last N sessions (name + date)
- Select an existing session and automatically follow its live updates
- Switching to an existing session adopts the agent, model, and variant it last ran with
- Create a new session
- Use OpenCode-generated session title (based on conversation)

### Task handling

- Send text prompts to OpenCode
- Accept voice/audio messages, transcribe via Whisper-compatible STT API, and forward recognized text as prompts
- Interrupt current task (ESC equivalent)
- Optionally queue text, transcribed voice, photos, rich formatted messages with photos, supported documents, and media groups sent while a task is running; hold at most `MAX_QUEUED_PROMPTS` (5) items and 20 MiB of raw Telegram media bytes, checked from reliable `file_size` before downloads
- Handle OpenCode questions with inline options and custom text answers
- Send selected/custom answers back to OpenCode (`question.reply`)
- Handle permission requests interactively (`allow once` / `always` / `reject`)

### Result delivery

- Send each completed assistant response after completion signal from SSE
- If that send fails, the reply is not sent again; when Telegram accepts sends again, the chat gets a notice that the last assistant reply was not delivered
- After a mid-session Telegram outage, the next new message is answered without restarting the app
- Compact output mode shows thinking and writing on its single progress message from the start of work; that message is removed or marked finished when the run completes
- Show elapsed time for tool calls running longer than 20 seconds, updated on a timer so it keeps counting while a tool blocks without producing output; covers subagent cards and compact mode, and the total duration stays on the finished tool line. In compact mode, while several tools of one step are in flight, the progress line shows the still-running one (the most recently started if several), with that tool's timer — not a finished sibling. A finished subagent card keeps the time its whole run took. Durations use the same `· 🕒 1h 2m 3s` format as the assistant run footer
- A subagent card shows Task, Agent, and Model; when OpenCode sends a variant, the Model line is `provider/id (variant)`
- Render assistant replies with native Telegram formatting: real tables with the column alignment declared in markdown, bullet lists with their nesting, block quotes that keep their nested content, headings, and syntax-highlighted code. Numbered lists and checklists keep literal markers (`1.`, ✅/🔲), because Telegram clients number a native ordered list from zero and do not draw the native checkbox at all
- Deliver reasoning as a collapsed quote that expands on tap
- Hide full model reasoning by default; optionally stream it in the thinking message when explicitly enabled
- Stream intermediate assistant/tool/thinking edits and pinned file-change updates once per second for the first minute, then slow down to 2s / 5s / 10s so long runs stay under Telegram rate limits; the interval resets when the run stops
- Split long responses into multiple Telegram messages, which is now rare: native messages hold 32768 characters instead of 4096
- Send code updates as files (size-limited)

### Session status in chat

- Keep a pinned status message in the chat; it can be turned off in `/settings` (default on)
- Show session title, project, model, context usage, and changed files; when a variant is set, the model line is `provider/id (variant)`
- Auto-update status from SSE and tool events
- Preserve pinned message ID across bot restarts

### Security

- Whitelist by Telegram user ID (single-user mode)
- Ignore messages from non-authorized users
- Ignore updates queued while the bot was offline or unreachable, so they are not executed on startup
- Mid-session, messages older than 60 seconds after an outage are still not executed; the chat gets one notice that messages were skipped while Telegram was unreachable
- If Telegram is unreachable at startup (network error, 5xx, 429), keep retrying with a growing delay capped at 60 seconds until it answers, then start polling; a rejected or invalid token (401/404) or any other fatal startup error logs the cause and exits the process with code 1 so a supervisor can restart it

### Configuration

- Telegram bot token
- Allowed Telegram user ID
- Default model provider and model ID
- Selected project persisted in `settings.json`

- Optional STT settings for voice transcription (`STT_API_URL`, `STT_API_KEY`, `STT_MODEL`, `STT_LANGUAGE`)
- Optional TTS settings for global audio replies (`TTS_PROVIDER`, `TTS_API_URL`, `TTS_API_KEY`, `TTS_MODEL`, `TTS_VOICE`); supported providers: OpenAI-compatible, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS, and Microsoft Edge TTS (no API key required)
- Optional IPv4-only mode for Telegram connectivity (`TELEGRAM_FORCE_IPV4`)

## Current Product Scope

### Bot commands

Current command set:

- `/status` - bot version, server, project, and session status
- `/new` - create a new session
- `/abort` - stop the current task
- `/detach` - detach the bot from the current session without stopping it; a later command or prompt HTTP failure for that session is not posted to chat unless the bot has re-attached to it
- `/sessions` - show and switch recent sessions
- `/messages` - browse user messages in the current session
- `/projects` - show and switch projects
- `/worktree` - show and switch existing git worktrees for the current repository
- `/settings` - change bot settings
- `/task` - create a scheduled task
- `/tasklist` - browse and delete scheduled tasks
- `/rename` - rename current session
- `/commands` - browse and run custom commands (plus built-ins like `init` and `review`)
- `/skills` - browse and run OpenCode skills
- `/opencode_start` - start local OpenCode server
- `/opencode_stop` - stop local OpenCode server; available during an active request and kills the local process even if health is hung
- `/help` - show command help
- `/ls` - interactive file browser for the current project directory; a text file can be attached to the next prompt from its detail view

Model, agent, variant, and context actions are available from the persistent bottom keyboard.

Text messages (non-commands) are treated as prompts for OpenCode only when no blocking interaction is active. Voice/audio messages are transcribed and then sent as prompts when STT is configured. When TTS mode in `/settings` is set to `all`, completed assistant replies include a generated audio file if TTS is configured. When it is set to `auto`, audio replies are sent only after voice/audio prompts.

Interaction routing rules:

- Only one interactive flow can be active at a time (inline menu, permission, question, rename, commands, skills, messages)
- While an interaction is active, unrelated input is blocked with a contextual hint
- Allowed utility commands during active interactions: `/help`, `/status`, `/abort`, `/detach`, `/opencode_stop`
- Unknown slash commands return an explicit fallback message
- Interaction flows do not expire automatically and wait for explicit completion (`answer`, `cancel`, `/abort`, `/detach`, reset/cleanup)

Model picker behavior:

- Uses OpenCode local model state (`favorite` + `recent`)
- Favorites are shown first, recent models are shown after favorites
- Models already present in favorites are not duplicated in recent
- Default configured model (`OPENCODE_MODEL_PROVIDER` + `OPENCODE_MODEL_ID`) is treated as favorite
- Models can be browsed by provider: the picker offers a providers list and a paginated model
  list per provider, with a back button on each screen (page size: `MODELS_LIST_LIMIT`)
- Picking a model opens the variant picker right after the confirmation when the model offers
  more than one selectable variant; a model with only `Default` ends at the confirmation

Agent picker behavior:

- Picking an agent applies that agent's configured model and/or variant when the agent names
  them; a field the agent does not name is left as it is. This is not a model pick and does
  not open the variant menu
